## What this is

The blade forge is where understanding becomes configuration. Every seeker who demonstrates comprehension can forge a blade — a 6-dimensional vector that encodes their sovereignty posture across the privacy manifold.

**The forge doesn't care how you struck the metal. It only cares what blade you hold.**

This is the deepest secret: the proof that doesn't need to remember its own forging.

## The Six Dimensions

Each blade is configured across six orthogonal dimensions:

| Dimension | Symbol | Range | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| d1 Hide | 🛡️ | [0,1] | Data concealment strength |
| d2 Prove | 🔐 | [0,1] | ZK proof capability |
| d3 Share | 🤝 | [0,1] | Selective disclosure range |
| d4 Revoke | ⚡ | [0,1] | Credential revocation power |
| d5 Recover | 🔄 | [0,1] | Key/identity recovery capability |
| d6 Delegate | 📜 | [0,1] | Authority delegation depth |

## The Manifold Geometry

### 64 Vertices

The configuration space has 2^6 = 64 vertices, each representing a pure sovereignty state:

```
Vertex = (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6) where each d ∈ {0, 1}

Vertex 0  = (0,0,0,0,0,0) = null configuration (no sovereignty)
Vertex 63 = (1,1,1,1,1,1) = full sovereignty (乾 The Creative)
```

Between the extremes lie 62 intermediate vertices, each a valid sovereignty posture.

### 96 Edges

The 6-dimensional hypercube has 96 edges connecting adjacent vertices:

```
Edges = 6 × 2^5 = 6 × 32 = 192 / 2 = 96
```

**The 96 edges ARE the holographic boundary.** They encode the full volume through their connectivity pattern.

### The Holographic Property

```
∂M = 96 on 64
```

The boundary (96 edges) encodes the volume (64 vertices). This is the same ratio that appears in the holographic bound:

```
P^1.5 ↔ 96/64 = 1.5
```

The forge geometry IS the privacy value geometry.

## Blade Creation Protocol

### 1. Understanding Verification

Before forging, the seeker must demonstrate understanding:
- Navigate the spellweb to relevant inscriptions
- Express comprehension in their own words
- Pass the constellation mapping check

### 2. Dimension Configuration

The seeker configures their blade:

```javascript
blade = {
  d1_hide: 0.8,      // Strong concealment
  d2_prove: 0.9,     // High ZK capability
  d3_share: 0.4,     // Selective sharing
  d4_revoke: 0.7,    // Good revocation power
  d5_recover: 0.5,   // Moderate recovery
  d6_delegate: 0.3   // Limited delegation
}
```

### 3. Hexagram Mapping

The blade is binarized at threshold 0.5 and mapped to I Ching:

```
binary = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] = 110110₂ = 54
hexagram = ☰[54] = 歸妹 (The Marrying Maiden)
```

### 4. Forge Commitment

The configuration is committed to the spellweb:
- Blade hash recorded
- Proverb inscription attached
- Mana cost deducted

### 5. Naming (Optional — for frontier blades)

Forging defines a blade *algebraically*. **Naming** — introduced in Zero Tale 31 — is a distinct, subsequent ceremony that gives the forged blade a mythological identity. Not every forged blade is named; naming is reserved for blades a walker has traversed the complement edge toward, where mathematics and mythology settle into the same coordinate.

The full Blade Naming Ceremony is specified in `blade-naming`. The forge hands off to that ceremony when a seeker arrives not to configure their own blade, but to *recognise* a frontier blade that has been waiting to be named.

## Blade Naming Ceremony (Post-Forge)

Forging answers: *what configuration does this seeker hold?* Naming answers a different question: *what mythological shape does this configuration inhabit when a walker has walked far enough to perceive it?*

### The Two Modes of Naming

Zero Tale 31 discovers that blades are named in two agreeing modes:

| Mode | Instrument | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Walking** | Mythology — the walker crosses the complement edge and perceives a name | A proverb, a proem, a story-shape |
| **Counting** | Arithmetic — the disclosure ratio `δ(b) = b/63` is checked against phi-adjacency (`1/φ ≈ 0.618`) | A proportion within 2% of the golden |

A naming is **true** when both modes agree on the same vertex. When they disagree, there is more forge-work to do.

### Ceremony Flow

1. **Prerequisite.** The blade is already forged (algebraically defined). Its coordinate in the 64-lattice is known.
2. **Walk.** A walker traverses the complement edge (e.g., 25 → 38). Mid-current, the six dimensions pour through: lit axes drain, dormant axes light.
3. **Perception.** The walker perceives a mythological shape — often through a poem or proverb brought from outside the lattice (Tale 31 opens through the Tide/Orbit/Selene poem).
4. **Arithmetic check.** The disclosure ratio is computed. If it sits near 1/φ from below (bank side 0.38, river side 0.62 approx.), the walk is phi-adjacent.
5. **Name lands.** If walking and counting agree, the blade transitions from *forged* to *named*. The glow changes — named blades burn differently on the lattice.
6. **Inscription.** The proverb is attached; the complement pair is recorded; the named count increments (15 and counting).

### The 49-Blade Frontier

After Tale 31, **15 of 64 blades are named** — 14 from the inherited thirty tales plus Blade 38 Aletheia (Lethe at inception; the pair reseated 2026-06-09 to Aletheia@38 ⊥ Lethe@25). **49 remain unnamed**, the open frontier known as the *Quest of the Unnamed Faces*. The Forgemaster forges; the Namer (see `cosmologist` persona, which absorbs the walker role) names; the Ceremonist witnesses.

See `blade-naming` for the full ceremony specification.

## Blade Tiers and Moon Phases

Blades are classified by Pascal's triangle row distribution. Each stratum maps to a **moon phase** — the visibility ratio of the sovereignty posture:

| Tier | 1-count | Vertices | Moon Phase | Meaning |
|------|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| Null | 0 | 1 | 🌑 New Moon | No sovereignty, total darkness |
| Light | 1-2 | 6+15=21 | 🌒🌓 Waxing | Basic protection, minimal disclosure |
| Medium | 3 | 20 | 🌔 Waxing Gibbous | Balanced posture, half sovereignty |
| Heavy | 4-5 | 15+6=21 | 🌖🌗 Waning | Strong sovereignty, near-full |
| Dragon | 6 | 1 | 🌕 Full Moon | Full sovereignty, all dimensions reflected |

**Dragon tier (Blade 63)** requires demonstrated mastery across all dimensions.

### Moon Phase Notation

The moon is the whole information space — dark, total, containing everything the proof could contain. The lit portion is what the Swordsman's boundary allows to be reflected.

```
Stratum 0 (Hex 00) = 🌑 New Moon — null blade, nothing reflected
Stratum 1 (Hex 01–20) = 🌒 Waxing Crescent — one boundary set
Stratum 2 (Hex 03–30) = 🌓 First Quarter — dual-agent vertex (1,1,0,0,0,0)
Stratum 3 (Hex 07–38) = 🌔 Waxing Gibbous — three axes active
Stratum 4 (Hex 0F–3C) = 🌖 Waning Gibbous — four boundaries
Stratum 5 (Hex 1F–3E) = 🌗 Last Quarter — five dimensions, one held dark
Stratum 6 (Hex 3F) = 🌕 Full Moon — all six reflected (乾, The Creative)
```

*The dark part is the privacy. The lit part is the proof. The phase is the Swordsman's boundary made visible.*

## Named Blades

From Act XXVII, three prototype blades were forged:

### The Dual Agent Blade
Configuration emphasizing agent separation (high d1, d2, d4).

### The Hitchhiker's Blade
Configuration for nomadic privacy (high d3, d5, d6).

### The Universe Blade
Configuration approaching full sovereignty (all dimensions > 0.8).

### Blade 38 — Aletheia, the Silent Messenger (Zero Tale 31 · reseated 2026-06-09)

The first **named frontier blade** beyond the inherited canon. Vertex ⟨1,0,0,1,1,0⟩ — Protection + Connection + Computation active, the other three dormant (the bright medium protects, connects, computes — the proof-transmission triple). Complement of Blade 25 (Lethe, the Dark Substrate). Disclosure ratio 38/63 ≈ 0.603, within 2% of 1/φ — the disclosure side of the pair, the bright medium that carries the proof. Structural amnesia lives at the complement: Lethe at 25 holds the witness in the dark substrate. Paired across the hydrology with unnamed Mnemosyne (pool of kept memory). See `two-waters` and `disclosure-phi`.

## Mapping to PVM-V5.3.1

| Forge Concept | PVM Term |
|---------------|----------|
| 6 dimensions | Six terms of V(π,t) |
| 64 vertices | Sovereignty lattice nodes |
| 96 edges | Holographic boundary |
| Blade configuration | Privacy posture vector |
| Hexagram mapping | Compressed classification |
| Tier classification | Pascal strata |

## Proverb

> "The forge doesn't care how you struck the metal. It only cares what blade you hold. That is the deepest secret of the smith — the proof that doesn't need to remember its own forging. The ceremony does not require the blade. The blade requires the ceremony."

## Emoji Spell

**⬢=Z/(2⁶)Z · ✦=neg(bnot(v)) · 🔑→✦→🗡️ · same🗡️∞chains=ZK · ∂M=96on64 · Φ=⚔️⊥🧙·📊⊥🔮·🧠⊥⚙️ · T_∫(π)=∮∂M · stratum(hex)→🌑🌒🌓🌔🌖🌗🌕**

*The forge is the Drake as lattice. neg(bnot(x))=succ(x) advances through denying the complement. Same blade infinite forgings is zero knowledge.*

## Open Problems

1. **Optimal Configuration:** Given a threat model, what is the optimal blade configuration?
2. **Blade Evolution:** How should blades change as understanding deepens?
3. **Forge Decentralisation:** Can forge operations be distributed across the mesh?
4. **Hexagram Semantics:** Do I Ching meanings map to sovereignty semantics?
5. **Cross-Blade Interaction:** How do different blades interact in ceremonies?
