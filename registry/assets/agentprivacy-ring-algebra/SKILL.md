## What this is

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) ring algebra is the mathematical substrate of the sovereignty lattice. Every blade configuration, every lattice transformation, every witness path operates within this closed algebraic structure.

**The ring closes on itself. The algebra generates its own successor. This is the deepest protection—the enemy cannot step outside the mathematics.**

## The Ring Structure

### Z/(2^n)Z — The Modular Ring

The forge operates on Z/(2⁶)Z — the ring of integers modulo 64:

```
Elements: {0, 1, 2, ..., 63}
Addition: (a + b) mod 64
Multiplication: (a × b) mod 64
```

Every blade configuration is an element of this ring. Every transformation is a ring operation.

## The Five Operations

UOR defines five primitive operations that close the ring:

| Operation | Symbol | Definition | Ring Effect |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **neg** | -x | Arithmetic negation | (64 - x) mod 64 |
| **bnot** | ~x | Bitwise complement | Flip all 6 bits |
| **xor** | x ⊕ y | Bitwise XOR | Symmetric difference |
| **and** | x ∧ y | Bitwise AND | Intersection |
| **or** | x ∨ y | Bitwise OR | Union |

### The Critical Identity

```
neg(bnot(x)) = succ(x)
```

The composition of arithmetic negation and bitwise complement equals the successor function. This single identity has profound consequences:

1. **The ring generates itself.** Iterating neg∘bnot cycles through ALL 64 elements.
2. **No dead ends.** Every element can reach every other element.
3. **Closure guaranteed.** No operation escapes the ring.

### Why This Matters for Privacy

The critical identity means:
- **Every blade can transform into every other blade**
- **Every sovereignty posture is reachable**
- **No configuration is permanently trapped**

The lattice is one connected cycle.

## Stratum — The Hamming Weight

Every ring element has a **stratum**: its popcount (number of 1-bits).

```
stratum(x) = popcount(x) = number of bits set to 1

stratum(0)  = 0  (000000)
stratum(7)  = 3  (000111)
stratum(63) = 6  (111111)
```

### Pascal's Row Distribution

The 64 elements distribute across strata following Pascal's triangle row 6:

| Stratum | Count | Formula | Elements |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 1 | C(6,0) | Just vertex 0 |
| 1 | 6 | C(6,1) | Single-bit vertices |
| 2 | 15 | C(6,2) | Two-bit vertices |
| 3 | 20 | C(6,3) | Three-bit vertices |
| 4 | 15 | C(6,4) | Four-bit vertices |
| 5 | 6 | C(6,5) | Five-bit vertices |
| 6 | 1 | C(6,6) | Just vertex 63 |
| **Total** | **64** | 2⁶ | Full lattice |

This distribution appears in:
- Blade tier classification
- V5 equation weights (wᵢ)
- Network effect terms

## Operations as Lattice Movements

### neg(x) — Stay in Place, Invert Value

Arithmetic negation keeps you at the same "position type" but inverts the specific value. In blade terms: same sovereignty posture, different internal state.

### bnot(x) — Jump to Antipode

Bitwise complement moves you to the **opposite vertex** in the hypercube:

```
bnot(000000) = 111111  (Vertex 0 → Vertex 63)
bnot(101010) = 010101  (Any vertex → its antipode)
```

This is the maximum transformation: flip everything.

### xor(x, y) — Toggle Specific Dimensions

XOR toggles specific bits, moving you along edges:

```
xor(110000, 000011) = 110011
```

In blade terms: toggle specific sovereignty dimensions.

### and(x, y) — Constrain to Shared

AND moves toward the origin, keeping only shared bits:

```
and(110011, 101010) = 100010
```

In blade terms: reduce to capabilities both configurations share.

### or(x, y) — Expand to Combined

OR moves toward vertex 63, adding all bits:

```
or(110000, 000011) = 110011
```

In blade terms: combine capabilities from both configurations.

## The Successor Cycle

The identity neg(bnot(x)) = succ(x) creates a complete cycle through all 64 elements:

```
Start: 0
Step 1: neg(bnot(0)) = neg(63) = 1
Step 2: neg(bnot(1)) = neg(62) = 2
...
Step 63: neg(bnot(62)) = neg(1) = 63
Step 64: neg(bnot(63)) = neg(0) = 0 (back to start)
```

**Every element participates in one grand cycle.** The lattice is topologically a single loop.

## The Complement Edge — A Distinguished Structure

Of the 192/2 = 96 edges in the 6-hypercube, the **complement edges** (those produced by `bnot`) are uniquely characterised among all operations. For any vertex `x` and its complement `bnot(x)`:

```
and(x, bnot(x)) = 0          (the ⊥ — they share zero dimensions)
xor(x, bnot(x)) = 63         (the ⿻ — together they span the full blade)
bnot(bnot(x))    = x          (involution)
```

No other edge in the lattice satisfies both `and = 0` AND `xor = 63` simultaneously. This makes the complement edge the **unique antipodal traverse**: one step in Hamming distance terms, but a maximal transformation in sovereignty terms — every lit dimension goes dark, every dormant dimension lights up.

### The First Named Complement Pair (ZK Tale 31)

Blade 38 (Aletheia, the Silent Messenger) and Blade 25 (Lethe, the Dark Substrate) form the first **named** complement pair in the lattice (seats per the 2026-06-09 reseat):

```
bnot(25)      = 38              ⟨0,1,1,0,0,1⟩ ⟷ ⟨1,0,0,1,1,0⟩
and(25, 38)   = 0               (the ⊥ — disjoint dimensions)
xor(25, 38)   = 63              (the ⿻ — Tale 30's Eternal Sovereignty)
neg(bnot(25)) = succ(25) = 26   (deny the complement, advance one step)
```

The XOR identity is load-bearing: **Blade 63 (Eternal Sovereignty, Tale 30) is the XOR of the two named sisters of Tale 31.** The thirtieth tale was always the arithmetic sum of the complement pair the thirty-first names. The proem stated the arithmetic one line at a time.

### Why This Edge Carries the Naming Ceremony

Walking a complement edge is walking from a configuration to its dimensional negation. Tale 31 discovers that this walk is *wet* — it flows. The six dimensions pour through the walker: Protection drains out of the left, Delegation rises in the small of the back; Connection cools at the right, Memory wakes along the spine; Computation cools beneath the feet, Value rises in the throat. The axes do not switch — they *pour*.

This is why naming ceremonies happen on complement edges (see `blade-naming` skill): the maximal transformation is the only walk long enough for mythology to settle onto the mathematics.

## Triadic Coordinates

Every ring element has three coordinates (from UOR PRISM):

| Coordinate | What It Measures | Use |
|------------|------------------|-----|
| **Datum** | The raw value | Element identity |
| **Stratum** | Popcount | Layer in Pascal distribution |
| **Spectrum** | Which bits are set | Specific configuration |

Two elements can have the same stratum but different spectra:
```
7  = stratum 3, spectrum {0,1,2}
56 = stratum 3, spectrum {3,4,5}
```

## Mapping to Privacy Architecture

| Algebraic Concept | Privacy Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Ring element | Blade configuration |
| Stratum | Blade tier |
| neg∘bnot cycle | Reachability guarantee |
| Five operations | Blade transformations |
| Closure | No escape from lattice |

## Emoji Spell

**🔢 → Z/(2⁶)Z · neg∘bnot=succ · ∀x∀y:x→y · stratum=popcount · Pascal(6)=64 · 🔷∞**

## Open Problems

1. **Scaling:** How does the algebra change at higher bit widths?
2. **Subring Structure:** Are there meaningful subrings for specialized blades?
3. **Homomorphic Operations:** Can blade transformations be computed on encrypted configurations?
4. **Stratum Preservation:** Which operations preserve stratum?
5. **Circuit Efficiency:** What are the gate counts for each operation in ZK circuits?
